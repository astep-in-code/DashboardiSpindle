iSpindle Dashboard is a Bootstrap tool to manage and visualize data about your iSpindle.
You can display Density, Temperature, Battery life, Wifi and many other things and export your database data to a csv file.
It's intended to work with a database, but you can tweak it to read data from a csv file instead.
Also it's in French, but you can easily translate this in English or whatever inside each php files.
Enjoy. -Nikko-

For now it displays data from only 1 device, could change that in the future.

ps : i'm not a dev, so the code is not clean and there's still unnecessary stuff inside.
Might clean that in the future, or might not ^^


## VERSION

- V 1.0.6 (Fixed PHP 7 compatibility issue)
- V 1.0.5 (updated the code to quit using cdn for local network users)
- V 1.0.4


## How to

- You need to creat the Data table inside your database, use the model inside the package
- Then inside your iSpindle configuration page, enter this "iSpindel000" for the name, then for "Service Type" use HTTP, for "Server Adress" enter your website adress (ex: mywebsite.com) and for "Server URL" your folder url (ex: /myfolder/)
- Edit index.php file and common_db.php (inside assets) with your database informations
- You also have to edit csvexport.php file with the same informations and can change this "$f = fopen('php://memory', 'w');" to this "$f = fopen('../csv/FILE_NAME.csv', 'w');" if you also want to export your csv to your ftp
- Edit line 57 on settings.php and replace "MONPASSWORD" with the password you want to use (don't use the same as the one for your database !)
- Send everything to your ftp  (keep the files structure !)
- Go to your dashboard page and change settings in "reglages", sorry it's in French but you can translate this in English or whatever inside each php files
